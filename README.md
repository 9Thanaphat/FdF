FDF is a 3D wireframe model viewer written in C using the MiniLibX graphics library. The project focuses on rendering 3D maps from 2D heightmap files, applying transformations, and displaying them using isometric projection. <br>
ðŸ›  Features <br>
âœ… Parses heightmaps from .fdf files <br>
âœ… Renders wireframe models using Bresenham's line algorithm <br>
âœ… Supports isometric projection for 3D visualization <br>
âœ… Implements basic controls for zooming and moving the model <br>
