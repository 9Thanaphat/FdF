FDF is a 3D wireframe model viewer written in C using the MiniLibX graphics library. The project focuses on rendering 3D maps from 2D heightmap files, applying transformations, and displaying them using isometric projection.\n
ðŸ›  Features
âœ… Parses heightmaps from .fdf files
âœ… Renders wireframe models using Bresenham's line algorithm
âœ… Supports isometric projection for 3D visualization
âœ… Implements basic controls for zooming and moving the model
